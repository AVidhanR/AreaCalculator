## Area Calculator using `#Python`

**About:**

- This Python code snippet implements a basic area calculator program within the `AreaCalculator` repository. 
- It offers a text-based menu for users to select the shape they want to calculate the area of, supporting circles, triangles, squares, and rectangles

**Functionality:**

1. **Menu:** Upon execution, the script presents a menu displaying the available shape options (circle, triangle, square, rectangle, and exit).
2. **User Input:** The user is prompted to enter their choice by selecting a number from 1 to 5 corresponding to the desired shape or 5 to exit the program.
3. **Area Calculation:**
   - If a valid shape choice (1-4) is entered, the code attempts to call the corresponding function from the `Areas` module (assumed to be a separate module containing the area calculation logic for each shape). These functions likely take the necessary dimensions (radius, base/height, side length, etc.) as input and calculate the area.
   - The description can be improved by mentioning that the specific implementation of these functions within `Areas` is not provided in this code snippet.
4. **Output (Optional):** It's assumed that the `Areas` module's functions handle outputting the calculated area in a user-friendly format (e.g., console print).
5. **Loop and Exit:** The code employs a `while True` loop to continuously display the menu and prompt for user input until the user chooses option 5 (Exit).
